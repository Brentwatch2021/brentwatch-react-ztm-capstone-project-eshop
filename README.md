# How to fork and clone
One quick note about cloning this project. If you wish to make commits and push your own code, you'll need to fork the project first. Forking allows you to have your own copy of this repository by adding a duplicate version in your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!

# After you fork and clone:

## Install dependencies
In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

## Set your firebase config

Remember to replace the config variable in your firebase.utils.js with your own config object from the firebase dashboard! Navigate to the project settings gear icon > project settings and scroll down to the config code. Copy the object in the code and replace the variable in your cloned code.

# Branching strategy

After forking this repository and cloning it down, you will have access to all the lesson branches with code at different checkpoints throughout the course. If for some reason you need to work from the codebase at one of these lesson branch checkpoints, follow these steps:

1. Checkout to the lesson-# (let's use lesson-15 as an example) branch
```
git checkout lesson-15
```
2. Branch off from lesson-15. This will create a new branch where the code of lesson-15 is the basis for your new branch. You can name your new branch whatever you want! Let's say we use my-main-branch as the name.
```
git checkout -b my-main-branch
```
3. Now you can just code on this branch, push code from this branch up to your forked repo etc. The main thing to remember is that you want to be on this branch for your own code, so remember what you named this branch!




# Notes

- Package-lock.json locks any specific library or package to the specific project to prevent version     clashes
-  SCSS allows you to follow an heirarchy for developing css and it compiles to normal css for the browser.

## Routing 
- Upgrading React Router V5 to V6 will result in breaking changes Here is the tutorial for upgrading:    https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/v5
- Great tutorial from React Router that will expose me to Vite: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial

- Fragment from react is used as a container for elements that require a parent but it does NOT render <Fragment>

- In react you are able to import an SVG and cast it as an Component and consume it as a Component

- box-sizing: border-box; accounts for total width and whatever the width is set it will auto the padding to fit within and the border IE if width is 90 and padding is 20 total width will be 90 NOT 110

- Outlet is used to display child content via the routes and any route within


```

<Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<NavigationBar/>}>
        <Route index element={<Home/>}/>
        <Route path="shop" element={<Shop/>}/>
      </Route>
</Routes>

// And in the Navigation Bar Component you can use the Outlet

<Fragment>
            <div className='navigation'>
                <Link className='logo-container' to='/'>
                    <CrwnLogo/>
                </Link>
                <div className='nav-links-container'>
                    <Link className='nav-link' to='/shop'>
                        SHOP
                    </Link>
                </div>
            </div>
        <Outlet/>
    </Fragment>

// Now if you navigate to / The Navigation Bar it will display all child content below the bar

// The Link is gets rendered into a normal anchor tag so in CSS or SCSS you can refer to it as a
